<p align="center"><strong>Policy-Controlled Payment Firewall for Autonomous Agent Actions on Stellar</strong></p>

Fortexa is a **policy-controlled payment firewall for autonomous agent actions on Stellar**.
It sits between agent intent and economic execution, applies governance/risk checks, and keeps an auditable decision trail.

This document reflects the **current implementation** in this repository.

---

## 1) ⚠️ Why This Matters

Agentic systems can now trigger real payments. That creates a new risk layer: high-speed model decisions can become high-impact economic actions.

Fortexa adds a control plane between intent and money movement:

- Policy checks before execution
- Risk scoring on suspicious behavior
- Human-approval gate for sensitive cases
- Wallet-native signed XDR flow
- Auditable evidence trail for every decision

In short: Fortexa is the safety layer for agentic payments.

---

## 2) 🚀 Jury Demo Flow (Fast Path)

If you only read one section, read this:

1. **Login with wallet** on `/login`.
2. **Evaluate action** in `/console`.
3. Receive decision: **`BLOCK` / `REQUIRE_APPROVAL` / `WARN` / `APPROVE`**.
4. For allowed flows, **build unsigned XDR → sign in wallet → submit signed XDR**.
5. Verify outcome with **Explorer link** and inspect evidence in `/activity` and `/ops`.

---

## 3) 🧭 Current Product Model

Fortexa currently runs with a strict wallet-bound model:

1. User logs in with wallet (`/login`).
2. Session is created with role (`operator` / `viewer`).
3. Session wallet is bound as execution source.
4. Actions are evaluated by policy + security engine.
5. Approved/warned decisions can proceed to signed-XDR payment flow.
6. Decision/audit evidence is stored and visible in `/activity` and `/ops`.

---

## 4) 🔐 Auth and Access Control

### 4.1 Wallet-only Login

Fortexa uses a challenge-signature login flow:

1. Client requests a one-time login challenge via `POST /api/auth/challenge` with the wallet public key (`G...`).
2. The server returns a short-lived challenge message bound to that wallet.
3. The wallet signs the challenge message (SEP-53 / Freighter `signMessage`).
4. Client posts `publicKey`, `challengeId`, and `signature` to `POST /api/auth/login`.
5. The server verifies the signature, enforces one-time challenge use + expiry, then issues `fortexa_session`.

Role is still resolved via allowlists:

- `FORTEXA_OPERATOR_WALLETS`
- `FORTEXA_VIEWER_WALLETS`

If both allowlists are empty, current behavior falls back to `operator` role for any valid wallet (recommended only for local/dev).

Session cookie: `fortexa_session` (HMAC-signed).

Challenge TTL: `FORTEXA_AUTH_CHALLENGE_TTL_SECONDS` (default `300`).

### 4.2 Role Permissions

- `operator`: full decision/policy/payment flow
- `viewer`: read-only experience on sensitive execution paths

### 4.3 Login Hardening

- Rate limiting
- Brute-force lockout (`FORTEXA_AUTH_MAX_ATTEMPTS`, `FORTEXA_AUTH_LOCK_MINUTES`)

> Note: MFA is removed from current implementation.

---

## 5) 👛 Wallet and Signing Model (Current)

Fortexa currently does **not perform server-side signing or private-key custody**.

- Session is wallet-bound at login.
- Execution source wallet is derived from session identity.
- Manual arbitrary wallet assignment in UI is removed.
- `/api/stellar/balance` auto-syncs missing wallet mapping from session when possible.

---

## 6) ⚙️ Decision and Payment Flow

### 6.1 Decisioning

- Policy engine: `src/lib/policy/engine.ts`
- Security analyzer: `src/lib/security/analyzer.ts`
- Decision engine: `src/lib/decision/engine.ts`

Decision outcomes:
- `BLOCK`
- `REQUIRE_APPROVAL`
- `WARN`
- `APPROVE`

`Human Approve & Re-run` applies only when prior result is `REQUIRE_APPROVAL`.

### 6.1a Policy Simulation (Pre-Save Safety Check)

Before committing a policy change, operators can dry-run the unsaved draft from the Policy editor (**Run simulation**). The draft is evaluated against the seeded demo scenarios — and, optionally, a small recent-audit sample — and the result shows each action's `current → proposed` decision so risky edits surface before they go live.

Simulation is strictly read-only: it never saves the policy and never consumes usage. Saving still happens only through `POST /api/policy`. See `src/lib/decision/simulate.ts` and `POST /api/policy/simulate`.

### 6.2 Signed XDR Payment Path

1. Evaluate action in `/console`.
2. Build unsigned tx: `POST /api/stellar/build-payment`.
3. `Submit Signed XDR` orchestrates signing/submission path:
   - if signed input is already present → submit directly
   - if unsigned input is present → wallet signing is triggered first, then submit
4. Submit signed tx: `POST /api/stellar/submit-signed`.
5. Explorer URL is returned and shown as clickable link.

**Idempotent retries:** `POST /api/stellar/submit-signed` accepts an optional idempotency key, supplied either as an `Idempotency-Key` request header or an `idempotencyKey` body field (the header wins if both are present). Results are stored per authenticated user + key + signed-XDR hash. Replaying the same key with the same signed XDR returns the original result (`200`, with header `Idempotency-Replayed: true`) without resubmitting to Horizon. Reusing the same key with a different signed XDR returns `409 Conflict`. Omitting the key preserves the original submit-on-every-request behavior. Keys must be 8–255 characters.

Additional behavior:
- XDR build timeout configured to 180 seconds.
- Submit errors include Horizon result codes when available.

## 7) 📜 Audit and Evidence

- Decisions are appended to audit store at evaluation time.
- `/activity` reads entries by authenticated session user id.
- Export endpoint supports `mine` and `all` scopes in JSON/CSV.

### Hash chain integrity

Every new audit entry is linked into a tamper-evident SHA-256 hash chain:

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| `previousHash` | `entryHash` of the immediately preceding entry, or `0000…0000` (64 zeroes) for the first hashed entry. |
| `entryHash` | SHA-256 of the entry's canonical fields (`id`, `timestamp`, `action`, `decision`, `explanation`, `triggeredPolicies`, `riskFindings`, `stellarTxHash`, `previousHash`). Object keys are sorted before hashing so DB-stored and file-stored entries produce identical digests. |

Both fields are included in JSON exports. CSV exports add `entryHash` and `previousHash` columns.

Verification helper: `verifyHashChain(entries)` in `src/lib/audit/hash-chain.ts` — returns `{ valid: true }` for an untouched log and `{ valid: false, reason }` when it detects a modified, deleted, or reordered entry.

Entries written before this feature was introduced carry no hash fields and are treated as **legacy** entries; they do not break verification of newer hashed entries.

## 13) 📈 Ops / Observability (Appendix)

- Health endpoint: `GET /api/health` — returns `blocklist` object with `configured`, `lastRefreshAt`, `domainCount`, `lastError`
- Metrics endpoint: `GET /api/metrics` + Prometheus format
- `/ops` dashboard shows:
  - service health
  - total requests
  - error rate
  - signed tx count
  - blocklist feed health (configured, domain count, last refresh, errors)
  - top routes + rolling trend

Ops dashboard initial load is optimized so core telemetry renders first; slow TX-count fetch no longer blocks first paint.

See [docs/observability.md](docs/observability.md) for the Prometheus scrape config, sample PromQL (request rate, error rate, p95 latency), and an example alert rule.

## 14) 💾 Persistence (Appendix)

### DB-first with File Fallback

Stores include:
- `audit-store`
- `policy-store`
- `user-wallet-store`
- `submit-idempotency-store`

If `DATABASE_URL` is available and healthy, Postgres is used.
Otherwise Fortexa falls back to local JSON files:
- local/dev default: `.fortexa/*.json`
- Vercel default: `/tmp/fortexa/*.json`

Optional overrides:
- `FORTEXA_STORE_DIR` to set file-store directory explicitly
- `FORTEXA_SHARED_STATE_PATH` for shared lockout/rate-limit state file path
  - use an absolute path on Vercel (example: `/tmp/fortexa/shared-security-state.json`)
- `REDIS_URL` for multi-instance deployments (e.g. Vercel)
  - uses a Redis-backed adapter with automatic, transparent fallback to the file store if Redis is unreachable or unconfigured.

### Versioned Migrations

- Migrations: `src/lib/storage/migrations.ts`
- Runner: `src/lib/storage/db.ts`
- Tracking table: `fortexa_schema_migrations`
- Manual run: `npm run db:migrate`

- **Language:** TypeScript
- **UI:** Tailwind CSS + custom UI primitives
- **Validation:** `zod`
- **Charts:** `recharts`
- **Stellar:** `@stellar/stellar-sdk`, optional `@stellar/freighter-api`
- **Database:** `pg` (optional Postgres, file fallback enabled)

---

## 16) 🧪 Known Limitations (Current)

1. Shared security state supports Redis distributed locking, but defaults to file-based for local development.
2. Risk scoring remains heuristic-heavy (no external threat-intel integration).
3. Stellar workflow is testnet-oriented.
4. Server-side signing remains intentionally disabled.
5. Full end-to-end automated coverage for the complete decision-to-payment lifecycle is still limited.

Fortexa is intentionally optimized for hackathon clarity and wallet-native control, not full production deployment.

---

## 17) ❓ Troubleshooting Payment Failures

Common Stellar Horizon failures during the signed payment flow:

- **`tx_bad_seq`**: The transaction sequence number is incorrect. Wait for pending transactions to clear or refresh your wallet state.
- **`tx_insufficient_fee`**: The provided fee is below the current network minimum. Increase the base fee.
- **`op_no_destination`**: The destination account does not exist on the network. Verify the destination address.
- **`op_underfunded`**: Your source wallet lacks the XLM necessary to complete the payment and satisfy the network base reserve.

---

## 18) 🛣️ Practical Next Steps

- Add stronger risk intelligence + anomaly detection.
- Expand end-to-end payment verification and automated lifecycle tests.
