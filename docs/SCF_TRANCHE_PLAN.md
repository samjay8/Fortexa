# Stellar Community Fund (SCF) Tranche Plan

This document outlines the funding tranches and key deliverables for Fortexa, structured around the Stellar Community Fund (SCF) Build-style framework. The deliverables are derived directly from the existing code structure, tests, database migrations, and observability tools implemented in this repository.

## Tranche 1: Policy Firewall Hardening and Reviewer Evidence

This tranche focuses on core policy validation engine rules, simulation checks, and cryptographic evidence mechanisms that verify the integrity of firewall decisions before transactions are signed.

### Deliverable 1.1: Deterministic Policy Rules Validation Engine
* **Scope**: Core deterministic policy checking rules governing spending caps, permitted hours, and allowed domain/tool scopes.
* **Repository Artifact**: [src/lib/policy/engine.ts](file:///c:/Users/ICT%20LASIEC/Fortexa/src/lib/policy/engine.ts)
* **Acceptance Criteria**: The file [engine.ts](file:///c:/Users/ICT%20LASIEC/Fortexa/src/lib/policy/engine.ts) exists, and all unit tests in [src/lib/policy/engine.test.ts](file:///c:/Users/ICT%20LASIEC/Fortexa/src/lib/policy/engine.test.ts) pass successfully.
* **Why it matters for Stellar agent payments**: Prevents autonomous agents from executing unapproved payment intents, exceeding daily spending budgets, or triggering payouts outside authorized business hours.
* **Risk Level**: Low

### Deliverable 1.2: Pre-Save Policy Simulation Engine
